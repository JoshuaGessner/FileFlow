// Aiming analysis (feature UI-02): tell a user how to point the receiver at the transmitter.
//
// WHY THIS IS A COMPONENT AND NOT A UI DETAIL. Getting the two phones into a workable geometry took
// FIVE hardware iterations, and every failure arrived as the same useless line in a decode log:
// "geometry failures 20 of 20". The distinct causes were a locked screen, focus at infinity, gross
// overexposure, a square sensor mode wasting its pixels, and a rotated screen overflowing the frame
// (F32, F33). A user with no decode log and no tooling has strictly less information than that.
//
// So the receiver has to diagnose its own aim and say what to change. That judgement lives here, in
// portable C++, for the reason ADR-0014 gives: it is real logic with real edge cases, it must be
// tested off-device, and a Kotlin implementation could not be.
//
// WHAT THE ANALYSIS RESTS ON. Screen localisation fits the four lines of the always-bright boundary
// ring and intersects them (F10). Two things follow, and they are the whole basis of the advice:
//
//   1. **Every edge of that ring must be inside the frame.** Miss one and there are not four lines
//      to fit, so detection fails outright no matter how good everything else is. This is the
//      failure that masquerades as "too dense" or "out of focus".
//
//   2. **Rotation is nearly free for the decoder and expensive for framing.** Measured: roll is
//      tolerated to at least 40 degrees with header success 1.0000 and zero detection failures
//      (F32). But the axis-aligned bounding box of a rotated rectangle is much larger than the
//      rectangle -- 2.24x at 36 degrees -- and it is the BOX that has to fit. So the advice for a
//      rotated screen is never "stop rotating"; it is "you need more margin, or align to reclaim
//      it".
//
// Deliberately NOT a detector. It never tries to find corners, fit a homography or read a cell. It
// answers a cruder and more useful question -- is the geometry workable, and if not what should the
// user do -- from a single cheap pass over the luminance plane.
