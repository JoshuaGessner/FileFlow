// Rectifying cell sampler (component C08) — image pixels to per-cell samples.
//
// Deliberately samples the image THROUGH the homography rather than warping the image
// first. Warping to a rectified buffer costs a full-frame resample (every pixel touched,
// interpolated and written) to produce an intermediate we then reduce to ~24,000 numbers.
// Sampling directly touches only the points we actually need -- roughly 4 samples per cell
// instead of ~100 pixels per cell -- and it avoids the extra interpolation generation that a
// warp-then-sample pipeline bakes into every value. It is also the shape that ports
// unchanged to a GPU shader, which ADR-0005 says the >=120 fps path requires.
