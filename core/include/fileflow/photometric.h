// Spatially-varying photometric normalisation (component C09).
//
// M0Modulator::EstimateReference gives ONE dark/bright pair for the whole frame. That is
// only correct if the illumination field is flat, and it is not: lens vignetting, uneven
// backlight, glare, and -- specifically for the Galaxy S26 Ultra -- the Privacy Display's
// restricted angular emission (RISK-025) all produce a brightness that varies across the
// frame. At 30 cm a 6.9" screen subtends a wide angle, so the receiver sees the corners
// substantially further off-axis than the centre, producing a radial falloff that belongs
// to the TRANSMITTER rather than the lens.
//
// A single global threshold placed halfway between the frame-wide dark and bright levels
// will therefore sit above the local bright level in dim corners, turning every cell there
// into a confident WRONG decision -- the worst possible failure, because a confident error
// costs the FEC layer roughly twice what an erasure costs.
//
// This class estimates dark and bright levels as smooth FIELDS interpolated from the
// distributed pilot lattice. It never assumes a cause, so it corrects lens vignetting and
// panel angular falloff identically. That property is the concrete reason layout Candidate B
// (pilots throughout the payload area) is expected to beat Candidate A (pilots on the
// border, forcing extrapolation inward). See docs/specifications/OPTICAL-FRAME-CANDIDATES.md.
