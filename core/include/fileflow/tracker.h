// Persistent screen tracking (component C06, second half).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL: ADR-0006's central claim is that "a persistent tracked grid should
// outperform repeated independent QR detection". Until this file existed the receiver did
// full-image acquisition on every frame -- i.e. we were doing the repeated-detection thing
// ourselves, and the project's founding hypothesis was untested in our own code.
//
// The saving is structural, not incremental. Full acquisition scans every pixel of the frame
// to find the screen. Tracking already knows roughly where the screen is, so it only has to
// confirm and refine within a small window around the previous quad. That turns an O(image)
// search into O(search window), and the window does not grow with sensor resolution -- which
// matters because sensor resolution is exactly what is growing.
//
// The state machine is deliberately conservative. Any doubt drops to reacquisition rather
// than propagating a drifting homography, because a slightly wrong homography is the failure
// mode that silently poisons every downstream stage (see ScreenDetector's verification note).
