// CaptureSource — the interface that makes offline development possible (ADR-0010).
//
// THREE implementations, one decoder:
//   - Android camera (platform/android/capture)   live
//   - Channel simulator (sim/)                    synthetic, exact ground truth
//   - Replay harness (harness/)                   recorded real captures
//
// The decode chain cannot tell which one it is running against. That substitutability is
// exactly why simulator and replay results transfer to live behaviour: if a bug reproduces
// in replay it is a real bug, and if a change improves simulated goodput it is a real
// change. Design this interface before the live receiver, never retrofit it.
