/**
 * Presents optical frames as a fullscreen quad (C03, the renderer half).
 *
 * ## The one idea that makes this cheap and exact
 *
 * The texture is uploaded at **cell resolution** (e.g. 144×240 = 34,560 bytes), not panel
 * resolution (1440×3120 = 4.5 MB), and scaled up with `GL_NEAREST`.
 *
 * That is **bit-exact, not an approximation**, and only because the cell pitch is required to be an
 * integer number of panel pixels (DEVICE-MATRIX). At an exact 10× horizontal and 13× vertical
 * factor, nearest-neighbour sampling reproduces precisely the pixels a full-resolution render would
 * have produced, for 1/130th of the upload. **If the integer-pitch requirement is ever relaxed this
 * stops being exact** and the renderer must draw at panel resolution instead.
 *
 * ## Why no filtering, anywhere
 *
 * `GL_NEAREST` on both min and mag filters, and no mipmaps. Any interpolation would blur cell
 * boundaries — softening exactly the high-spatial-frequency edges the receiver's sampler exists to
 * resolve, and doing it on the transmitter where no amount of receiver cleverness can undo it.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT claim
 *
 * It reports states **submitted** and vsyncs **observed**. It does not report `Fd`. A transmitter
 * cannot confirm presentation — that is the premise of the sequence number in every frame header
 * (`frame.h`), and `Fd` is a quantity the RECEIVER measures by decoding those numbers. Calling a
 * submission rate `Fd` would be exactly the unlabelled-rate defect ADR-0012 forbids.

     * about 10 cells, which puts an entire corner marker outside the emitting area (F34). Screen
     * localisation finds the quad from the extremes of `x+y` and `x-y` and then verifies the corner
     * markers, so both steps fail while framing, focus, exposure and density all look healthy.
     *
     * The simulator renders a perfect rectangle and cannot exhibit this at all, which is what makes it
     * RISK-024's failure mode rather than a bug: a kinder-than-reality model producing a confident
     * wrong conclusion.
