/**
 * A camera preview drawn from the luminance plane we already have, on a canvas we control.
 *
 * ## Why not a TextureView or a SurfaceView
 *
 * Five attempts to orient the preview through the platform's view classes failed, and the last
 * one failed while *reporting success*: the `TextureView` returned `identity=false` from
 * `getTransform` and mapped its content to `(0,240)-(1080,2160)` — rotated, letterboxed, exactly
 * right — while the composited screen showed an unrotated image filling all 2400 rows. The matrix
 * was held and not honoured. Whatever the reason, the operator saw a sideways, stretched preview
 * through every one of those attempts and said so every time (F38, F41, F42, F43, F44).
 *
 * The platform is not required for this. The receiver **already reads every frame's Y plane on the
 * CPU** for aim analysis, so the pixels are in hand before any of this starts. Copying them into a
 * `Bitmap` and drawing that through a `Canvas` matrix puts the rotation somewhere it cannot be
 * quietly dropped: there is no `SurfaceTexture`, no compositor transform hint and no producer
 * queue between the decision and the pixels.
 *
 * ## Why grayscale is not a compromise
 *
 * The link is luminance-only (M0). A grayscale preview shows the operator precisely what the
 * demodulator sees, which is *more* informative than a colour-corrected one — an image the ISP has
 * prettied up can look fine while the levels it is built from are unusable.
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * The Y plane is subsampled by an integer stride while copying, to about 720 px on the long edge,
 * and repainting is throttled. Nothing is interpolated and no frame is copied whole: at 2688×1512
 * that is a quarter-resolution strided read, which is cheaper than the aim analysis running beside
 * it.
