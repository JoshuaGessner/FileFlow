# Architecture decision records

> **Status:** Draft
> **Owner:** Architecture
> **Last reviewed:** 2026-08-02

Every decision that shapes the system lives here, not in chat logs or commit messages.

## Format

Each ADR contains: **Context, Decision, Alternatives, Consequences, Evidence, Risks,
Validation plan, Status.**

## Status values

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Proposed** | Decided provisionally; evidence is insufficient. Most Phase 0 ADRs are here. |
| **Accepted** | Supported by evidence recorded in the ADR. |
| **Superseded** | Replaced; the superseding ADR is named. Never deleted. |
| **Rejected** | Considered and declined; kept so the reasoning is not relitigated. |

An ADR at **Proposed** is a decision we are acting on while acknowledging we might be
wrong. Each one names the experiment that would confirm or overturn it.

## Note on confidence

ADR-0008 has the lowest confidence of any decision we are acting on. Differential
modulation is a central plank of the prescribed architecture, but we found no primary
evidence for it during Phase 0 research and the theoretical argument cuts both ways.
It is worth reading that ADR before relying on the optimisation path it describes.
